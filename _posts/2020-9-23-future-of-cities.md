### Event Description
 About this Event

Three billion urban dwellers in our world today stand testament to the irreplaceable function of cities in our society. By 2035, cities are expected to hold 2 more billion people. Of the three billion people today, one billion people already live below the poverty line. This number is expected to double to 2 billion by 2035.

While population is expected to double in the next ~20 years, due to the nature of cities, land area covered by cities is unlikely to scale linearly from the current 0.3 - 3.5%.

Scale, speed and scarcity are all challenges in the growing dense urban environments of cities. In addition to this, cities will be contributing directly to the challenges faced by our planet suffering from a worsening climate crisis.

However, with great challenges come great opportunities. Three young entrepreneurs in San Francisco are on a mission to save our future by tackling power, food and space in urban areas.

Join Keiarra Ortiz-Cedano, Christelle Rohaut and RJ DeLong in an hour-long panel discussion on how they are building solutions for cities to equitably maintain the quality of life for every person sustainably. Furthermore, learn how you can personally prepare for the future.

The panel discussion will be moderated by climate activist and Climate Reality Leader Rayyan Zahid who is a researcher in complex systems and holds a degree in Chemical Engineering.
