### Event Description

In "Climate Crisis and its Solutions", Rayyan will answer three major questions about the climate crisis.

1) The science behind Climate Change
2) How the Climate Crisis is already affecting billions of people in 2020
3) Is there a case for optimism for the future? If yes, then what is it?

The presentation is backed with our updated understanding of climate science and includes numerous examples of how the Climate Crisis is already affecting our world in 2020. There is a need for alarm but also optimism with regards to solving the crisis. Creative solutions to the problem are emerging as businesses, communities and governments take action.

There is no charge for this online event, but please RSVP in advance. Following the presentation there will be a Q&A session. Questions can be submitted in advance by emailing Moderator name at moderator email. They can also be posted in the chat room during the meeting. 

This event is a private event and only available for those invited by AIESEC GIKI.
