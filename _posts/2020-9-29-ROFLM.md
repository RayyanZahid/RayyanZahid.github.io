### Event Description

#### Youth Take Lead Project
With only ten years remaining to achieve agenda 2030, there is emphasis on the need to engage young people in all activities that are critical to making the SDGs a reality. Climate action is a catalyst to achieving all the other SDGs.
Young people form the greater part of the population and their energies and ideas are ideal to influencing change.
  
In February 2020, 22 youth-led organized were conveyed by the Youth Empowerment Synergy Ghana at the SDG Youth Academy where the idea to undertake such project was born. With Ghana’s youthful population, increasing awareness about climate action and recruiting
more advocates is a big step towards reaching the masses and taking action against climate change.

#### Climate Change (SDG 13)
Climate Change is the defining issue of our time. From shifting weather patterns that threaten food production, to rising sea levels that increase the risk of catastrophic flooding, the impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale. Without drastic action today, adapting to these impacts in the future will be more difficult and costly.

Greenhouse gases occur naturally and are essential to the survival of humans and millions of other living things, by keeping some of the sun’s warmth from reflecting back into space and making Earth livable. But after more than a century and a half of industrialization, deforestation, and large-scale agriculture, quantities of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have risen to record levels not seen in three million years. As populations, economies and standards of living grow, so does the cumulative level of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions.
