### About the event

Paper discussion events are events where we'll discuss a paper in the field of existential risk. Every week we hope to discuss a new paper. Members are free to propose a paper by for the upcoming weeks by messaging to the admin.

Proposer of the paper, if accepted will have to read, digest, summarize and produce the paper in a simple approachable manner for the wider audience. Critique on the paper or new insights gained from reading the paper contextualized to modern times are encouraged.

The purpose of paper discussion events is to make scientific literature available to the public and to build a heightened sense of awareness about the nuances of human/life's existence on Earth.

This is a free event, but please RSVP in advance. You can email the admin on the email: connect@rayyanzahid.com.

### Abstract
With very advanced technology, a very large population of people living happy lives could be sustained in the accessible region of the universe. For every year that development of such technologies and colonization of the universe is delayed, there is therefore a corresponding opportunity cost: a potential good, lives worth living, is not being realized. Given some plausible assumptions, this cost is extremely large. However, the lesson for standard utilitarians is not that we ought to maximize the pace of technological development, but rather that we ought to maximize its safety, i.e. the probability that colonization will eventually occur. This goal has such high utility that standard utilitarians ought to focus all their efforts on it. Utilitarians of a ‘person affecting’ stripe should accept a modified version of this conclusion. Some mixed ethical views, which combine utilitarian considerations with other criteria, will also be committed to a similar bottom line.

### Partner Organization Details

Welcome humans far and wide! We’re an online and in-person group hosting live speaking events on a range of topics that concern our future. You can join us in person if possible or on one of our live streams. Look out for our virtual happy hours and other networking events.

This is a group for anyone interested in our collective future from the lens of science, design, social systems, systems thinking, complex systems, existential risks, biology, transhumanism, finance and economics and so on. All skill levels are welcome. I started this group to meet other people actively working to preserve life on Earth.

Let's get together for affordable activities in our communities, like reading at the library, online presentations on topics that enrich us, having discussion picnics at Dolores Park, and compete to publish things together.
